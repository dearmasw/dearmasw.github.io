# Day 1 - The Camera Obscura

## Mozi's Effect
Mozi was an ancient Chinese philosopher who lived around 350 BCE. He is the earliest person to describe what happens when light goes through a small hole into a dark place. It actually creates an upside-down and smaller image on the other side!

![Pasted image 20230527215818.png](app://3db5f11a90a19aee48b750fb8381c81f16de/Users/winstondearmas/Documents/Obsidian%20Vault/Pasted%20image%2020230527215818.png?1685239098823)
This meant that a box with a teeny-tiny hole could become a picture-making machine. Here's how Mozi explained the effect:

1.  **Tiny hole, Big science:** Imagine a box that is really good at keeping light out, except for a super small hole on one side. This tiny hole acts like an eye. When you point the box at something you want to photograph, light from that scene sneaks into the box through this tiny hole.
    
2.  **Creating the Picture:** As light comes through the tiny hole, it moves in straight lines. Light rays from every point of the scene you're trying to capture go through the hole and hit the back wall of the box.
    
3.  **Upside-down Picture:** The light rays crossing through the tiny hole mix and match on the back wall of the box. Because the hole is so small, these rays spread out, making a clear but dim picture. But guess what? This picture is a topsy-turvy version of the scene you're capturing - it's upside-down and switched from left to right.

Mozi's explanation teaches us the basic principles that helped invent all the cameras we use today.

## Al-Haythem's Dark Room
Let's time travel to the 11th centry CE and meet a clever scientist named **á¸¤asan Ibn al-Haytham**, who lived in modern day Iraq and Egypt. In his book "Book of Optics," he wrote about a special room that was really, really dark, with just one tiny hole in the wall. Light would sneak in through this hole and the scene outside would be projected upside-down on a wall inside the room, just like our pinhole camera.

Ibn al-Haytham was also the first to understand how our eyes work and how we see things. He figured out that vision happens in our brains, not just in our eyes. He noticed that what we see can be different from person to person because of our own experiences.

He did all of his work by doing experiments and using math to support his ideas. This made him a very special scientist, even before the European Renaissance scientists we often hear about. But he didn't stop there! Ibn al-Haytham was also really good at many other things like philosophy, theology, and medicine.

## Leonardo's Box
Fast forward a few hundred years to 1500 CE in Italy, and let us meet the amazing artist and scientist, Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo was able to build a box that behaved just like Al-Haythem's dark room. 

![Pasted image 20230527212140.png](app://3db5f11a90a19aee48b750fb8381c81f16de/Users/winstondearmas/Documents/Obsidian%20Vault/Pasted%20image%2020230527212140.png?1685236900256)

He set up a box with a small hole to let the light in. With his box, Leonardo could capture the world in a unique way, a bit like seeing through a magical lens. He used it to help him understand how things looked smaller when they were far away, and bigger when they were close by. This is what we call 'perspective',  and it made his paintings look incredibly real.

The box also helped him to capture tiny details that might be hard to see with just our eyes. He studied how light and shadow worked together to give things shape and depth. Leonardo loved to experiment and discover new things, so he spent lots of time studying how light traveled through the hole to form an image. This would have been a very fun, yet challenging part of his work!

One of the coolest things about the camera obscura is that it could project a scene onto a wall in a way that's easier to study. It was like having a big, flat screen showing a live movie of the world outside. This helped Leonardo paint with amazing accuracy. Plus, he could study how light and shadow played together, making his art even more lifelike.

## Problems
But not everything was perfect. These are just a few of the issues Leonardo faced:
1. Leonardo's box was big and heavy, making it tough to carry around. 
2. You needed just the right amount of light to get a clear image. If it was too dark, the picture would be fuzzy and faint. If it was too bright, the picture would be too washed out. 
3. Getting the right amount of light was a problem because the size of the pinhole also affected how sharp or blurry the image was. You might get more light with a larger hole, but the image would also get more blurry.
4. It still showed the picture upside down, so Leonardo had to flip it around in his mind.
5. The image was not permanent. To preserve them, Leonardo still had to trace and paint the scenes himself.


Despite these challenges, Leonardo and many others found the camera obscura really helpful for making art and understanding how our eyes see the world. 


# Day 2 - Image Quality
By the early 1600s, Leonardo's Box was being called "camera obscura" by most people. This term seems complicated but it just means "dark room" in Latin. Notice that word "camera" actually just means "room". The word "chamber" actually has the same origin!

Instead of relying on the tiny hole to make the images, scientists learned to make special glass instead. This meant that you could allow more or less light in, without making the image blurry.

## Kepler's Lens
Johannes Kepler was a famous scientist who was great at studying the stars and solving math problems. In one of his books called "Dioptrice" that was published in 1611, he wrote about using a round piece of glass, called a lens, in the camera obscura. 

Think about looking through a pair of binoculars or a telescope, or even just your eyeglasses if you wear them. Lenses help us see things more clearly and in greater detail. The same thing happened with the camera obscura when lenses were added.

1.  **Brighter Images:** Lenses are like light catchers. They can scoop up more light than a tiny pinhole can. This means that images inside the camera obscura could become brighter and more detailed, even when the sun isn't super bright.
    
2.  **Sharper Pictures:** Lenses can take light and sharpen it into a clear, focused picture. This means the camera obscura started showing really crisp and sharp pictures. It's like moving from a blurry old TV to a brand new high-definition one!
    
3.  **Bigger Views:** Lenses can also make images look bigger, like when you use a magnifying glass. This meant that the scenes projected inside the camera obscura could be larger, so you could feel like you're right in the scene you're watching. Imagine seeing a tiny bird outside, but inside the camera obscura, it looks as big as you!

Kepler never actually did it himself, but Athanasius Kircher, a scholar from the same era, learned a lot from Kepler's writings.  He was probably one of the first people to use Kepler's ideas in real life. He used all that knowledge to build new camera obscuras with lenses that made better pictures.

Adding lenses to the camera obscura made it even better. Scientists, artists, and just plain curious folks found it super useful for studying the world around them. This clever upgrade to the camera obscura brought us even closer to the cameras we use today.

## Zahn's handheld
Early versions of the camera obscura were big and heavy, which made them hard to carry around. Over time, people worked on ways to make them smaller and easier to move. This meant that the camera obscura could be used outside or in different places, and not just in one spot. People started making them lighter, smaller, and easier to put together and take apart. This let people use them in more ways and places.

In 1685, a man named Johann Zahn came up with an **idea** for a handheld camera obscura that you could take with you anywhere. He wrote about it in a book. His version of the camera obscura was a box that you could hold in your hand. It had a lens and a mirror that could project an image onto a piece of frosted glass or paper. This new version of the camera obscura was much easier to use and move around than the big room-sized versions that people had been using.

However, making this handheld camera obscura wasn't easy, and Zahn was ever able to build it! There were lots of challenges:

1.  **Making Parts**: The tools and techniques people had back then might not have been good enough to make all the detailed parts needed for the handheld camera obscura.
    
2.  **Glass Quality**: The glass available then might not have been clear enough to create a sharp, clear image.
    
3.  **Making Lenses**: Making lenses wasn't as advanced back then. It would have been hard to make lenses with the right shape and properties to create a good image.
    
4.  **Size and Weight**: It would have been hard to make the handheld camera obscura small, light, and easy to use with the materials and techniques they had.
    
5.  **Light Sensitivity**: The early camera obscuras were very sensitive to light. It was hard to control the lighting, especially outside, which could affect the quality of the image.
    
Despite these challenges, people kept improving the camera obscura. By the 1700s, there were versions that looked like books. These were popular with people who liked optical devices. There were also versions that artists could use for painting.

![[Pasted image 20230527224423.png]]

These were used by amateur artists while traveling but also by professional artists. For example, artists like Paul Sandby and Joshua Reynolds had portable camera obscuras that they used to make paintings.

Eventually, these cameras were adapted by Joseph Nicephore Niepce, Louis Daguerre, and William Fox Talbot to create the first photographs. These improvements took the camera obscura from a big, hard-to-move device to something that could be used to capture the world around us in photographs.

# Day 3 - Drawing with Light
The camera obscura still faced the problem that it needed someone to actually trace and paint the images that it produced. This meant that regular people could not take pictures themselves.

In the late 1700s, scientists discovered that a chemical called silver iodide changes when you shine light on it. This discovery was really important for photography.

One of these people was Thomas Wedgwood, an English scientist. He tried to capture pictures using chemicals like silver nitrate and silver chloride, which also react to light. He wasn't able to make these pictures last forever, but his experiments were a big step towards understanding how these chemicals react to light.

Another scientist, Humphry Davy, also played a big role. He tested how silver chloride and other chemicals reacted to light and tried to create pictures with them. His experiments showed that these silver compounds could potentially be used to capture images.


## Daguerrotype
The first big step in taking pictures without needing to draw them by hand was the invention of something called the daguerreotype. This was a method developed by a man named Louis-Jacques-MandÃ© Daguerre, and he showed it to the world in 1839.

![[Pasted image 20230528085537.png]]

The daguerreotype was a way to make a direct picture on a shiny silver-coated copper plate that was sensitive to light. Remember when we talked about how light changes silver iodide? That's the idea they used here! Silver iodide salt changes when light touches it. This happens because light, made up of super tiny light sparks, carries a lot of energy. When these sparks hit the silver particles in the salt, they transform them into shiny silver.

Daguerre use this neat trick to take pictures. He spread silver salts on a plate or film and exposed it to light. More light makes parts of the plate darker, and less light makes parts lighter, forming an image.

Before the daguerreotype, if you wanted to capture a scene, you had to draw it. But with the daguerreotype, the picture could be made right onto the plate with the help of some extra chemicals, creating a real photograph that you could hold and even make copies of.

Even though the daguerreotype was the first method that really worked for taking photographs, you still needed someone who knew how to handle and process the plates properly. However, this was a big step forward. It made it possible to capture images without needing to draw them by hand.

So, we often say that Louis-Jacques-MandÃ© Daguerre invented the daguerreotype process. He figured out a way to make photographs without needing an artist to draw what they were looking at.

### Issues
The daguerreotype, the first type of photography, had some problems:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbbH77rYaa8 from 10:20 to 14:44

1.  **It took a lot of time:** Imagine if you had to stand super still for minutes or even hours just to take one picture! This was the case with the daguerreotype. It wasn't great for photographing anything that moved because the picture would end up blurry.
    
2.  **You couldn't make copies:** Each photo taken with a daguerreotype was unique because it was made on a metal plate. There was no way to make extra copies of the same photo, which wasn't very handy if you wanted to share it with multiple people.
    
3.  **The pictures were delicate:** The metal plates with the photos on them could get damaged pretty easily. They had to be kept in special cases to protect them from getting scratched or tarnished.
    
4.  **The photos were shiny:** The silver surface of the metal plates was very shiny. This meant it could be tricky to see the photo properly because it would reflect light.


![[Pasted image 20230528105327.png]]

    
5.  **The photos lacked detail:** The daguerreotype process struggled to capture all the details of light and shadow in a scene. This meant that the pictures didn't always show all the subtle shades and differences in brightness you see in real life or in photos today.
    
6.  **Movements made the photos blurry:** Since it took a long time to take a photo, any movement while the photo was being taken would blur the picture. This made it difficult to take clear pictures of anything that moved, like people in action or animals.


## Eastman's Film
Film is an important part of the history of photography. It was invented by George Eastman in the late 19th century. He created the Eastman Kodak company, and invented rolls of flexible plastic that could be used in cameras. This plastic was called "film" and it solved several problems that were present with the daguerreotype:

1.  **Took a lot of time**: The daguerreotype made people wait for a long time to take a picture. But film made it quicker! You didn't have to stand still for too long. This meant you could take pictures of things that moved without them looking blurry.
    
2.  **Couldn't make copies**: The daguerreotype only made one unique photo. But with film, you could make lots of copies of the same photo. This way, you could share it with many people.
    
3.  **Pictures were delicate**: The metal plates used for the daguerreotype could get easily damaged. Film was made of a flexible material that was stronger and less likely to get scratched or ruined.
    
4.  **Pictures were shiny**: The daguerreotype pictures were hard to see properly because they reflected light. But film didn't have that problem. It didn't shine, so you could see the pictures better.
    
5.  **Pictures lacked detail**: The daguerreotype had a hard time capturing all the details of light and shadow in a scene. But film was better at it! It could show more details and make the pictures look more like what we see in real life.
    
6.  **Movements made pictures blurry**: The daguerreotype took a long time to take a photo. So if something moved, the picture would be blurry. But with film, the time was shorter, so pictures of moving things looked clearer.
    
Film made photography easier and more enjoyable. It let us capture moments quickly, make copies of our favorite photos, and see more details in our pictures.

## Electrical sensors
Willard Boyle and George E. Smith invented CCD sensors in 1969. These were made of a special material called silicon.

Inside the CCD sensor, there were lots of tiny light-sensitive parts called pixels. When light hit these pixels, they turned the light into an electrical charge. This charge was like a signal that told the camera how much light there was in each part of the picture.

The camera then used these signals to create an image with electricity. Having images made of electricity meant that you could do a lot of new things with the images, including:
1. Show them on TV screens
2. Share them across long distances on wires

But even though CCD sensors were great at capturing pictures, they had some downsides. They needed more power to work, so the camera's battery would run out faster. Also, they were a bit more expensive to make.

In 1993, a team of scientists and engineers at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory developed something called the CMOS image sensor. It's a special type of sensor that helps digital cameras capture pictures. The CMOS sensor is different from other sensors because it uses less power and works faster. This made it really popular in digital cameras and other cool gadgets.

Today, these electrical images can be saved on smart phones, uploaded to the internet, and viewed on social media websites! What a long way we've come.

# Day 4 - Control
As we saw in previous lessons, it's important to be able to control how much light gets into the box. If too much light gets in, the image will be washed out and pale. If too little light gets in, the image will be dark and shadowy.

The two things that need to be controlled are the size of the hole for light to get in (aperture), and the amount of time the hole is left open (shutter speed).

![[Pasted image 20230528174742.png]]

## Waterhouse stops
Leonardo Da Vinci experimented with different sizes of holes to let light into his camera obscura. However, he had to do it all manually. 

In the mid-1800s, John Waterhouse, an English doctor and photographer, invented a simpler tool called the Waterhouse stops. These were thin metal plates with different-sized holes that could be put in front of the lens. By changing the plates, photographers could make the hole bigger or smaller to control the amount of light getting into the camera. But it was a bit tricky and not very precise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gM1VqW1CxY

## Petzval's iris
A few years later, Joseph Petzval, a Slovakian mathematician, invented a better method called iris diaphragms. These are like little metal blades that can move to make the hole bigger or smaller. It's like opening and closing an eye! Iris diaphragms made it easier to adjust the aperture more precisely, giving photographers better control over the picture's brightness and focus.

Thanks to adjustable apertures, photographers can create different effects in their pictures, like blurring the background or making everything sharp. As cameras got more advanced, the aperture systems also got better and could be controlled electronically.

So, by changing the aperture, photographers can be more creative and take amazing pictures with just the right amount of light.


## Kodak fixed shutter
In the past, camera lenses had to be opened manually by using a small paddle or cap to cover and uncover the lens. When they wanted to take a picture, they would remove the cap or open the shutter to let light enter the camera and hit the photosensitive plate inside. The amount of time the lens was open depended on how much light there was and the effect they wanted to achieve. Sometimes, they had to wait for a few seconds or even several minutes to get the right amount of light.

In 1888, a camera called the Kodak No. 1 was introduced by a man named George Eastman. It had an automatic shutter that opened and closed when you pressed a button. This made taking pictures so much easier because you didn't have to cover and uncover the lens yourself.

Back then, the shutter speed (how long the shutter stayed open) was fixed, which means it couldn't be changed. It was set to a certain speed, and you couldn't make it faster or slower. This was okay because the Kodak No. 1 was made for people who wanted to have fun taking pictures without worrying about complicated settings.

## Deckel's Focal Plane Shutter
As time went on, people wanted more control over their photos. In 1889, Friedrich Deckel invented something called the Focal Plane Shutter. This special shutter allowed photographers to choose different shutter speeds. They could make the shutter stay open for a short time or a long time, depending on what kind of picture they wanted to take.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C_BOCVp02I 0:27 to 1:18

Nowadays, cameras have all sorts of amazing features, including adjustable shutter speeds. You can choose how fast or slow the shutter opens and closes, which helps you capture the perfect moment just the way you want it.

So, thanks to clever inventors and their amazing ideas, we can take pictures with different shutter speeds and have so much fun capturing our favorite moments!


# Day 5 - The Future
Now that you know all about the history camera technology, it's time to gather in groups and talk about the problems we see in cameras today and come up with cool solutions for the future. Are you ready?

Here's what we'll do:
1.  Get into small groups with 3-5 friends.
2. Talk about the history: Talk about what the most important parts of the camera's history were to you. Why were they so important?
3.  Share problems: Each person tells one problem they see with cameras nowadays. Write down the problems!
4.  Think of solutions: Let's be creative! In your group, come up with ideas to solve the problems you shared. Think about how technology could help or what new things cameras could do. Remember, we want practical and realistic solutions.
6.  Future fun: Let's imagine what cameras might be like in the future. Share your thoughts and what you think will be cool!
7.  Wrap it up: Each group can summarize what they discussed. Make a little video and share with the group. We'll all listen and learn from each other's ideas.

Remember, this is a chance to think, solve problems, and dream about the future of cameras. Enjoy the talk, have fun, and let your imagination fly high!
